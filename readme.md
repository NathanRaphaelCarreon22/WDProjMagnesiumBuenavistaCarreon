<font size="4"> Description: </font>
This is a website that aims to help players that are new to Valorant better understand the game. It contains useful information on the Weapons, Characters, and other core factors in the game. It serves as complement to the in-game tutorial, which teaches about game mechanics and controls, teaching new players about other things that are not explicitly stated. By using interactive-visuals, beginner-friendy explanations, and accurate information, we pursue a better learning experience for new players.
